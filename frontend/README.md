## üìò Use Case

This template provides a fully on-chain **escrow system** for two parties to exchange SPL tokens securely.  
The maker initializes an escrow with a token deposit and conditions, and a taker can fulfill those conditions within a time limit to complete the trade.  
Supports mutable and timed escrows with optional cancellation and updates.

## üìù Escrow Flow

1. **Make**: Maker deposits Token A into a vault and defines:
   - Token B (expected from taker)
   - Amount to receive
   - Duration (relative expiry)
   - Mutability flag

2. **Take**: Taker sends Token B to maker, and in return receives Token A from the vault

3. **Cancel** (by maker): If the escrow is still active, the maker can withdraw Token A

4. **Update** (by maker): If `is_mutable` is true, update Token B, amount, or expiry
